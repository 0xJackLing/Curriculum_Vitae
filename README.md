### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

#### Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Institute of Engineering Management (2021.06 - 2021.08)

Research Intern of Project: _The Whole-Process Supply-chain Quality Management of Engineering Materials Based on Information Flow_, Supervisor: Prof. XU Feng, Prof. HU Hao, Advisor: Mr. WANG Wen.     

* Research on application of Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to the field of civil engineering for supply-chain
quality management, especially for the proof of inspection reports, and design a new structure based on real demands among various parties to replace the traditional centralized ones, using smart contracts to implement quality compliance reviews.

### INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE

#### Shanghai Tree-Graph Blockchain Research Institute (Conflux Network) (2021.09 - 2022.07)

Research & Operation of Conflux Hydra hard fork and Mainnet routine maintenance, Supervisor: Dr. LONG Fan, Advisor: Mr. WANG Zhenghao.    

* Organize 24 rounds of community beta tests for the [hard fork version binaries](https://github.com/conflux-fans/Conflux-PoS-test/releases) and give feedbacks. The hard fork is mainly for introducing finality via voting on a stand-alone PoS chain to protect against potential 51% attacks from PoW, and introducing a fully EVM compatible space parallel to previous blockchain.
* Assist in providing technical support to Developers Community, especially in [technical documentations](https://forum.conflux.fun/t/conflux/11990), tutorials, and translations. Assist in reviewing and Incubating ecosystem projects on Conflux.

### PROJECT EXPERIENCE

#### A Secure Data Sharing Platform Based on Blockchain+IPFS+SM2 Algorithm (2020.09 - 2021.03)

National Project, [No. 202119145011X](http://gjcxcy.bjtu.edu.cn/NewJTItemListForStudentDetail.aspx?ItemNo=851412&year=2021&type=school&IsLXItem=0), Supervisor: Prof. LU Ning.    

* Research on implementation of a secure backup system via IPFS, which also uploads proof of backup process on Ethereum to ensure tamper-proof and traceability, and encrypts the objectives via asymmetric encryption algorithm SM2. Individually mainly focus on topic selection, node establishment, and cryptography research.
* Derivative Publication: Zhengyu Hu, Wenrui Liu, **Shengchen Ling**, Kuan Fan, “_Research on multi-objective optimal scheduling considering the balance of labor workload distribution_”, PLOS ONE, August 5, 2021, [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255737](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255737). Individually mainly focus on formal analysis, verifications, and writing & reviewing.

#### A Sharing Platform of IoT Key Data Based on Oracle (2020.12 – 2021.05)

Provincial Project, No. 2021H030110, Advisor: Mr. YU Qilong.    

* Research on implementation of Chainlink Oracle based on previous blockchain study, to solve the problem of actively obtaining off-chain data, specifically in this project, IoT data.
