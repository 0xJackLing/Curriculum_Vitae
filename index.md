### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

#### Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Institute of Engineering Management (2021.06 - 2021.08)

<font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Research Intern of Project: _The Whole-Process Supply-chain Quality Management of Engineering Materials Based on Information Flow_, Supervisor: Prof. XU Feng, Prof. HU Hao, Advisor: Mr. WANG Wen.</font>        

* <font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Research on application of Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to the field of civil engineering for supply-chain quality management, especially for the proof of inspection reports, and design a new structure based on real demands among various parties to replace the traditional centralized ones, using smart contracts to implement quality compliance reviews.</font>   



### INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE

#### Shanghai Tree-Graph Blockchain Research Institute (Conflux Network) (2021.09 - 2022.07)

<font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Research & Operation of Conflux Hydra hard fork and Mainnet routine maintenance, Supervisor: Dr. LONG Fan, Advisor: Mr. WANG Zhenghao.</font>       

* <font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Organize 24 rounds of community beta tests for the [hard fork version binaries](https://github.com/conflux-fans/Conflux-PoS-test/releases) and give feedbacks. The hard fork is mainly for introducing finality via voting on a stand-alone PoS chain to protect against potential 51% attacks from PoW, and introducing a fully EVM compatible space parallel to previous blockchain.</font>
